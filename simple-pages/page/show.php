  <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">Transcribe@Yale invites you to interact with Yale's digital collections by transcribing historic manuscripts. Our digital library holds hundreds of thousands of items &mdash; much more than library staff could ever catalog alone, so we're appealing to the public to help out by attaching text in the form of transcriptions, tags, and comments. By sharing your expertise on manuscripts that are in unusual scripts (such as Cherokee syllabary) or difficult to read, you are allowing a wider audience of researchers to benefit from our digital collections.</div>
  <div class="col-md-5">Through "crowdsourcing," or engaging volunteers to contribute effort toward large-scale goals, these mass quantities of digitized artifacts become searchable, allowing researchers to quickly seek out specific information, and general users to browse and enjoy the materials more easily. Please join us in preserving and interpreting our past by keeping the historic record accessible &mdash; one page or picture at a time.</div>

		 <h2>What is the goal of this project?</h2>
	 </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">The goal of Transcribe@Yale is to make historic documents more accessible – both by enhancing catalog records for greater ease in searching and browsing, and by engaging the public to interact with the materials in new ways. While typeset texts can be scanned with OCR (optical character recognition) technology to quickly and inexpensively add full text searchability, there’s no such easy fix for other primary source materials like handwritten documents or photographs. Making these items findable requires time-consuming manual labor to transcribe or describe each item – a process that doesn’t scale with traditional library workflows.</div>
	<div class="col-md-5"> By outsourcing this work to volunteers, users can search on this added text to more quickly and easily find what they’re seeking. With Transcribe@Yale, we’re also hoping to attract new users interested in more active engagement with the collections. By volunteering their time to help make these materials more accessible, participants can learn new information about past eras while assisting others, including researchers using the documents, as well as the original authors and photographers whose stories they're helping to preserve.</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">Transcribe@Yale is based on the University of Iowa's DIY History (Thank you, Iowa!); source code and documentation is available for institutions who wish to build a similar transcription project.</div>
	<div class="col-md-5">The transcription pages use Omeka for content management, the Scripto plugin for transcribing, and Twitter Bootstrap for the frontend framework.</div>
